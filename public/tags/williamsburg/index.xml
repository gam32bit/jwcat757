      <description>I want to look at equity issues at WJCC schools beyond this story on driver&amp;rsquo;s education not being offered at Lafayette High School with the highest minority student population, but content to get started.</description>

      <description>This year&amp;rsquo;s Juneteenth celebration in Williamsburg was super fun and educational. I hope next year it will be a bigger countywide event.

      <description>The Board of Supervisors approved a couple of Special Use Permits against the recommendation of the planning commission this past week. These are the first cases I&amp;rsquo;ve reported on from start to finish since I started doing journalism in Virginia. You can read my planning commission coverage here and the discussion at this month&amp;rsquo;s joint meeting to get the full story.</description>

      <description>This week I had a few pieces come out in the Gazette, including my coverage of the JCC Board of Supervisors meeting. Two of the main topics of discussion were possible new regulations for short-term rentals as well as plans for new libraries.</description>

      <description>I covered the school board in Austin for the Monitor, and now I&amp;rsquo;m covering the WJCC school board. The main points of comment at the latest meeting were the book removal at a couple of local high schools as well as the nontransportation zones which are expected to apply to elementary schools in the coming school year.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be covering more James City County Board Meetings and continuing to learn more about local politics. I also covered the following WJCC school board meeting where the division approved their budget as well, including a 7% raise for teachers.</description>

      <description>I covered a sidewalk project that has been several years in the making near Clara Byrd Baker Elementary School. I had been trying to get hold of the school&amp;rsquo;s principal for an interview without any luck, but when I went to the site to take photos I ended up running into him! Journalism 101.</description>

      <description>I felt like I was back in Austin doing my housing beat when I attended the JCC Planning Commission Meeting this past week.
If city commission meetings were D&amp;amp;D games does that make staff the DM?

      <description>I did a preview piece on Pedal the Parkway which is happening this weekend. Can&amp;rsquo;t speak for my readers but I know my wife and I were hesitant to go on the chance we could be charged the entrance fee. I also posted a video with Emil from the Bicycle Co-Op explaining how he fixes up old bikes:

      <description>I attended the Williamsburg Landing Arboretum Arbor Day celebration a week ago. One of the great things about reporting is learning new vocabulary like &amp;ldquo;cultivar,&amp;rdquo; a plant variety produced by selective breeding. I also posted a video of Grounds lead Justin Drewery explaining how to properly plant a potted tree:

      <title>Historic Jamestowne Volunteers</title>

      <description>I had the chance to go behind the scenes at Historic Jamestowne and meet some of the volunteers who work in the conservation lab as well as interpreters at the fort site. As a teenager visiting Historic Jamestowne, I mostly remember the heat. Now as an adult who actually appreciates history, I found everything there fascinating. It is very much an active archaeological site with new digs happening all the time, and I plan to go back soon.</description>
