      <description>Better sidewalks and new bike lanes are coming to the area around the Norge Shopping Center. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been to Norge in a minute. It was nice to visit and take some pictures.

While reporting for this story I had the chance to volunteer at the Grove rec center for a beginning of summer festival, and it was a pleasure getting to meet the residents.</description>

      <description>It will be interesting to see how the entrance fee controversy with Colonial Parkway earlier this year plays out in the context of this bigger rehabilitation project as far as the community&amp;rsquo;s relationship with the National Park Service.</description>
