      <description>X-Glide, winner of the Study Your Arts event
I competed and reported on the Study Your Arts dance competition at this year&amp;rsquo;s Something in the Water festival in VA Beach. It was a blast to return to the dance scene where my artistic journey began and be able to give back by covering the event as a journalist. So much talent among the young dancers - I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see what happens next.</description>
