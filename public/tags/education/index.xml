      <description>I covered the school board in Austin for the Monitor, and now I&amp;rsquo;m covering the WJCC school board. The main points of comment at the latest meeting were the book removal at a couple of local high schools as well as the nontransportation zones which are expected to apply to elementary schools in the coming school year.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be covering more James City County Board Meetings and continuing to learn more about local politics. I also covered the following WJCC school board meeting where the division approved their budget as well, including a 7% raise for teachers.</description>

      <description>I covered a sidewalk project that has been several years in the making near Clara Byrd Baker Elementary School. I had been trying to get hold of the school&amp;rsquo;s principal for an interview without any luck, but when I went to the site to take photos I ended up running into him!
