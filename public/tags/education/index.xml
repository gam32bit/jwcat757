      <description>I have four stories in the August Issue of Virginia Business: one on Richmond&amp;rsquo;s repeal of minimum parking requirements, one on a couple of Virginia startup incubators competing for a SBA grant, one on a new tuition-assistance program at MBU, and one about the city of Bristol&amp;rsquo;s switch to a new destination marketing organization in Southwest Virginia.
This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve published my work in a magazine - happy to put another notch on my journalism belt!</description>

      <title>JCC Terminates School Contract</title>

      <description>I spoke with a few different sources after James City County announced it would end its contract with the school division, and people were in shock. I will be covering the school board work session tomorrow, where the superintendent is expected to speak publicly for the first time on it. Will be interesting to see how this issue develops into the fall, when the City of Williamsburg plans to start its feasibility study on starting its own school division.</description>

      <title>WJCC New Library Rule</title>

      <description>The new policy takes away parents&amp;rsquo; abilities to remove books for all children at a school like what happened earlier this year. It followed a memo by the state superintendent, but I&amp;rsquo;m curious if other localities will interpret it in the same way.</description>

      <description>I want to look at equity issues at WJCC schools beyond this story on driver&amp;rsquo;s education not being offered at Lafayette High School with the highest minority student population, but content to get started.</description>

      <description>This week I reported on Dominion Energy Solutions pitching solar roofs to WJCC schools. It brings me back to when I reported on solar power in Austin.</description>

      <description>This week I had a few pieces come out in the Gazette, including my coverage of the JCC Board of Supervisors meeting. Two of the main topics of discussion were possible new regulations for short-term rentals as well as plans for new libraries.</description>

      <description>I covered the school board in Austin for the Monitor, and now I&amp;rsquo;m covering the WJCC school board. The main points of comment at the latest meeting were the book removal at a couple of local high schools as well as the nontransportation zones which are expected to apply to elementary schools in the coming school year.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be covering more James City County Board Meetings and continuing to learn more about local politics. I also covered the following WJCC school board meeting where the division approved their budget as well, including a 7% raise for teachers.</description>

      <description>I covered a sidewalk project that has been several years in the making near Clara Byrd Baker Elementary School. I had been trying to get hold of the school&amp;rsquo;s principal for an interview without any luck, but when I went to the site to take photos I ended up running into him!
