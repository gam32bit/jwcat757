      <description>After I moved back to Virginia, I had the opportunity to start taking pictures as part of my reporting for the Gazette. Starting in July, I&amp;rsquo;ve made more of an effort to practice the craft and learn about photography. Here are some of the shots I took in my spare time around the Williamsburg area.

      <description>I have four stories in the August Issue of Virginia Business: one on Richmond&amp;rsquo;s repeal of minimum parking requirements, one on a couple of Virginia startup incubators competing for a SBA grant, one on a new tuition-assistance program at MBU, and one about the city of Bristol&amp;rsquo;s switch to a new destination marketing organization in Southwest Virginia.
This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve published my work in a magazine - happy to put another notch on my journalism belt!</description>
