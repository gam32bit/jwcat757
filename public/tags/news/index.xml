      <description>Today I published a story for Virginia Mercury about failures of the state&amp;rsquo;s psychiatric system, specifically not having enough beds to accomodate those in mental health crisis. I recorded a video walkthrough on how I was able to write some simple code in Python to extract, analyze, and visualize the data from a public records request that became the basis of this story.

      <description>It will be interesting to see how the entrance fee controversy with Colonial Parkway earlier this year plays out in the context of this bigger rehabilitation project as far as the community&amp;rsquo;s relationship with the National Park Service.</description>

      <description>I want to look at equity issues at WJCC schools beyond this story on driver&amp;rsquo;s education not being offered at Lafayette High School with the highest minority student population, but content to get started.</description>

      <description>This year&amp;rsquo;s Juneteenth celebration in Williamsburg was super fun and educational. I hope next year it will be a bigger countywide event.

      <description>My wife and I were visiting the Virginia Institute of Marine Science for their annual Science Day open house, and I realized I should probably write a story about it! It&amp;rsquo;s amazing all of the cool places I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of when I went to school in the area a decade ago. Definitely plan on going back!

      <description>The Board of Supervisors approved a couple of Special Use Permits against the recommendation of the planning commission this past week. These are the first cases I&amp;rsquo;ve reported on from start to finish since I started doing journalism in Virginia. You can read my planning commission coverage here and the discussion at this month&amp;rsquo;s joint meeting to get the full story.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s still unclear why over $6 million in USDA funding for VA farmers and food banks took so long to be released. This was one of those stories that was developing as I was covering it which is always exciting if a little nerve-wracking.</description>

The main points of comment at the latest meeting were the book removal at a couple of local high schools as well as the nontransportation zones which are expected to apply to elementary schools in the coming school year.</description>

      <description>I covered a sidewalk project that has been several years in the making near Clara Byrd Baker Elementary School. I had been trying to get hold of the school&amp;rsquo;s principal for an interview without any luck, but when I went to the site to take photos I ended up running into him! Journalism 101.</description>

      <description>I felt like I was back in Austin doing my housing beat when I attended the JCC Planning Commission Meeting this past week.
If city commission meetings were D&amp;amp;D games does that make staff the DM?

      <description>I did a preview piece on Pedal the Parkway which is happening this weekend. Can&amp;rsquo;t speak for my readers but I know my wife and I were hesitant to go on the chance we could be charged the entrance fee. I also posted a video with Emil from the Bicycle Co-Op explaining how he fixes up old bikes:

      <description>I attended the Williamsburg Landing Arboretum Arbor Day celebration a week ago. One of the great things about reporting is learning new vocabulary like &amp;ldquo;cultivar,&amp;rdquo; a plant variety produced by selective breeding. I also posted a video of Grounds lead Justin Drewery explaining how to properly plant a potted tree:

      <description>X-Glide, winner of the Study Your Arts event
I competed and reported on the Study Your Arts dance competition at this year&amp;rsquo;s Something in the Water festival in VA Beach. It was a blast to return to the dance scene where my artistic journey began and be able to give back by covering the event as a journalist. So much talent among the young dancers - I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see what happens next.</description>

      <description>I had the chance to go behind the scenes at Historic Jamestowne and meet some of the volunteers who work in the conservation lab as well as interpreters at the fort site. As a teenager visiting Historic Jamestowne, I mostly remember the heat. Now as an adult who actually appreciates history, I found everything there fascinating. It is very much an active archaeological site with new digs happening all the time, and I plan to go back soon.</description>

      <description>I published my first article in the Virginia Mercury on the only privately run prison in Virginia, Lawrenceville Correctional Center. I obtained a series of memos from the Virginia Department of Corrections that showed GEO Group, the private operator, has had $4.3 million in contract breaches since 2018. I uploaded the memos to DocumentCloud along with the contract and other related documents.</description>
