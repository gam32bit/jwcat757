      <description>X-Glide, winner of the Study Your Arts event
I competed and reported on the Study Your Arts dance competition at this year&amp;rsquo;s Something in the Water festival in VA Beach. It was a blast to return to the dance scene where my artistic journey began and be able to give back by covering the event as a journalist. So much talent among the young dancers - I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see what happens next.</description>

      <description>I had the chance to go behind the scenes at Historic Jamestowne and meet some of the volunteers who work in the conservation lab as well as interpreters at the fort site. As a teenager visiting Historic Jamestowne, I mostly remember the heat. Now as an adult who actually appreciates history, I found everything there fascinating. It is very much an active archaeological site with new digs happening all the time, and I plan to go back soon.</description>

      <description>I published my first article in the Virginia Mercury on the only privately run prison in Virginia, Lawrenceville Correctional Center. I obtained a series of memos from the Virginia Department of Corrections that showed GEO Group, the private operator, has had $4.3 million in contract breaches since 2018. I uploaded the memos to DocumentCloud along with the contract and other related documents.</description>
