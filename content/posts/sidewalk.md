I covered a [sidewalk project](https://www.dailypress.com/virginiagazette/va-vg-james-city-county-safe-sidewalks-20230510-2pn27vj5h5dw5fu6aklsu77que-story.html) that has been several years in the making near Clara Byrd Baker Elementary School. I had been trying to get hold of the school's principal for an interview without any luck, but when I went to the site to take photos I ended up running into him! Journalism 101.
