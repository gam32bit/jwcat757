I had the chance to go [behind the scenes at Historic Jamestowne](https://www.dailypress.com/virginiagazette/va-vg-jamestown-volunteers-20230429-y252gz3bdzco7i6mu4baauc6nu-story.html) and meet some of the volunteers who work in the conservation lab as well as interpreters at the fort site. As a teenager visiting Historic Jamestowne, I mostly remember the heat. Now as an adult who actually appreciates history, I found everything there fascinating. It is very much an active archaeological site with new digs happening all the time, and I plan to go back soon. I also uploaded some supplemental interviews I did to youtube:
